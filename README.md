# Augment Swebench Agent

Welcome to the **Augment Swebench Agent** repository! This project is part of the Dimvy Clothing Brand's initiative to augment and automate workflows using advanced agent-based technologies.

## 🚀 Overview

The Augment Swebench Agent is designed to enhance software development productivity by integrating with [Swebench](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/SWE-bench) and automating repetitive tasks, error detection, and code management. It aims to provide tools for:

- Automated error fixing and code linting
- Execution and testing of code changes
- Security and vulnerability detection
- Project and codebase management
- Duplicate code detection and resolution

## 🛠️ Features

- **Error Detection & Fixing**: Automatically finds and suggests fixes for common code errors.
- **Execution & Testing**: Runs and verifies code changes in a secure, sandboxed environment.
- **Security Tools**: Scans for vulnerabilities and hides sensitive code from exposure.
- **Code Management**: Supports configuration, project management, and automation tasks.
- **Duplicate Code Finder**: Detects and helps resolve duplicate code segments in the codebase.
